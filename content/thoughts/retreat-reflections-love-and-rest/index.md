I recently sat a week-long retreat up in the San Bernadino Mountains.
It was led by some [some](https://insightla.org/teacher/beth-sternlieb/) [teachers](https://www.matthewbrensilver.org/) who I've sat with in the past, and it was an excellent opportunity to get some intensive practice in.
I was glad to have the space for clarity as I prepare for some some big life changes,{{< sidenote >}}More info in the next few months :eyes:{{< /sidenote >}} and several questions that have loomed over me for a long time feel like they loosened up, so I thought they'd be good to share here.
In the process of writing this I realized that there was simply too much to fit into one thing, so there will likely be follow-on writings that all intertwine on some of the themes touched here.

Retreats are a unique experience for lay practicioners, since we so rarely get the opportunity for in-depth practice in this way.
This can make retreats somewhat harrowing: high upside with the cost of hours on hours stuck inside one's own mind.
Hopefully that experience improves over time, but the first several days (or longer!) of any retreat are bound to be somewhere between uncomfortable and downright miserable.{{< sidenote >}}[Donald Rothberg](https://www.donaldrothberg.com/) told me on my first retreat that the majority of his job in leading retreats is to tell students "yes that's normal."{{< /sidenote >}}

What most often happens for me is that I tend to latch on to a few particular phrases that ring in my ears for the whole retreat.
They're teachings that feel aspirational -- I get them conceptually, but I don't _get_ them.
They're not baked into my nervous system.

And so I sit, day after day, letting them work their way through me.
It can be horrifying to watch your mind try and make sense of wisdom.
Wisdom all too often clashes with this or that aspect of our worldview, and so the mind has to digest them, often prodding and attacking an idea until it has no alternative but to consider and integrate it.

Eventually, something gives.

### Being a Grown-up

{{< epigraph cite="Ursula K. LeGuin, The Left Hand of Darkness" >}}
To be an atheist is to maintain God. His existence or nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof.
Thus _proof_ is a word not often used among the Handdarata, who have chosen not to treat God as a fact, subject either to proof or to belief: and they have broken the circle, and go free.

To learn which questions are unanswerable, and _not to answer them_: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.
{{< /epigraph >}}

On the opening night, a teacher defined wisdom as "being grown-ups about our existential condition."
Similarly, the oft-quoted Bible verse from 1 Corinthians: "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."

These aren't pejorative statements.
They're simply teaching us to be more clear with ourselves.

For a long time, I was agonized by the Big Question: *what's this all for?*
Our lives are complex and confusing, and we need something to help us navigate.

Whole societies focus themselves on refining belief systems around this question.
And "belief systems" here applies in the broadest sense -- whether that be religious systems, economic systems, philosophy, nationalism, corporations, ideologies, cults, you name it.

{{< epigraph cite="David Foster Wallace, [This is Water](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/#:~:text=in%20the%20day%2Dto%2Dday%20trenches%20of%20adult%20life%2C%20there%20is%20actually%20no%20such%20thing%20as%20atheism)" >}}

In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism.
There is no such thing as not worshipping.
Everybody worships.
The only choice we get is what to worship.
{{< /epigraph >}}

And this question has bounced around in my skull for decades, waiting for the universe to unveil to me its *[telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology)*.
Everything would be clear and unambiguous; I'd finally be able to get on with my life because at least now it has a _point_.

But that hasn't happened.

This is for a few reasons, the most likely of which is that the universe simply _doesn't_ have a grand purpose.
With a wide enough lens, "purpose" and "meaning" as concepts simply cease to make sense.{{< sidenote >}}Despite some [really excellent arguments](https://meaningness.com/) for it{{< /sidenote >}}
But I posit that **putting aside meaning leads to more degrees of freedom than holding onto it**.

These may be valuable frames, and for many people they are nearly load-bearing to their worldviews, so I'm not here to encourage throwing out helpful tools.
But they're not a ground.
Making something "meaningful" requires a perspective -- meaningful *with respect to what*.
For most of us, moments are meaningful to *us*.
What's meaningful to me is not necessarily meaningful to you, so all of our meaning-making systems are inherently self-centered.

And so meaning so often is co-opted as another tool by which we enforce our own egoic framework out onto others.
It is another way in which we try to orient ourselves in a sprawling, confusing, chaotic world that we cannot understand.

Meaning is a tool -- it's something to hold on to as we gradually acclimate ourselves to more and more degrees of freedom.

{{< epigraph cite="Ajahn Sucitto, '[Awareness Doesn't Follow Orders](https://ajahnsucitto.org/articles/awareness-doesnt-follow-orders/)'" >}}
You can liken the process [of awakening] to a gradual descent out of the tumult and the gridlock of your personal world into the free space of the unconditioned. It’s rather like lowering oneself down a rope. You have to know how to do that. It’s a matter of holding on to something you trust – even though it seems like a thin strand – then letting go a little bit and trusting the downward movement.
{{< /epigraph >}}

Centuries of continental philosophy and millions of pages of hand-wringing have been spent on the ambiguous nature of meaning, trying to rationalize it to a point where it makes sense.
This is understandable: a lack of clarity on this front means that our lives are inherently insecure, that change is inevitable *no matter what we do*.
Our inheritance as animals is to fear this, and so we devise tricks, use our brains to find ways around this.
If only we can make the world like *this* then I'll be fine.
Once I get *this* much more I'll be done and can enjoy myself.
But it is not so.

And so to be a grown-up about our existential condition means to see our delusions clearly, to know ourselves.
We have to put down a tool that we're done with in order to pick up something better.

### Finding a Wise Response

Remember: putting aside meaning leads to more degrees of freedom than holding onto it.
What I've written so far may sound awfully nihilistic, but it is not so.

Putting aside meaning isn't a cause for concern: it's a cause for care.
