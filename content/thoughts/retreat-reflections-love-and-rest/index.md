I recently sat a week-long retreat up in the San Bernadino Mountains.
It was led by some [some](https://insightla.org/teacher/beth-sternlieb/) [teachers](https://www.matthewbrensilver.org/) who I've sat with in the past, and it was an excellent opportunity to get some intensive practice in.
I've got some big life changes{{< sidenote >}}More info in the next few months :eyes:{{< /sidenote >}} coming up, and getting some space and perspective gave me a lot of clarity on a few issues, which I thought might be interesting to document here.

Retreats are a unique experience for lay practicioners, since we so rarely get the opportunity for in-depth practice in this way.
This can make retreats somewhat harrowing, high upside with the cost of hours on hours stuck inside one's own mind.
Hopefully that experience improves over time, but the first several days (or longer!) of any retreat are bound to be somewhere between awful and unbearable.

What most often happens for me is that I tend to latch on to a few particular phrases that ring in my ears for the whole retreat.
They're teachings that feel aspirational -- I get them conceptually, but I don't _get_ them.
They're not baked into my nervous system.

And so I sit, day after day, letting them work through me.
It can be horrifying to watch your mind try and make sense of real wisdom.
Real wisdom all too often clashes with this or that aspect of our worldview, and so the mind has to digest them, often prodding and attacking an idea until it has no alternative but to consider and integrate it.

Eventually, something gives.

### Being a Grown-up

{{< epigraph cite="Ursula K. LeGuin, The Left Hand of Darkness" >}}
To be an atheist is to maintain God. His existence or nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof.
Thus _proof_ is a word not often used amond the Handdarata, who have chosen not to treat God as a fact, subject either to proof or to belief: and they have broken the circle, and go free.

To learn which questions are unanswerable, and _not to answer them_: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.
{{< /epigraph >}}

On the opening night, a teacher defined wisdom as "being grown-ups{{< sidenote >}}To be clear, this isn't meant as a pejorative, although I had the same criticism myself at first.{{< /sidenote >}} about our existential condition."
For me, this evoked a very clear message: so many of our attempts at making sense of the world are deluded.

For a long time, I was agonized by everyone's Big Question: *what's this all for*?
Our lives are complex, confusing, and we need something to help us all navigate.
Whole societies focus themselves on refining belief systems around this question.
And "belief systems" here applies in the broadest sense.

There is no such thing as not worshipping.
Everybody worships.
The only choice we get is what to worship."

And this question has bounced around in my skull for decades, waiting for the universe to unveil to me its [*telos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology).
