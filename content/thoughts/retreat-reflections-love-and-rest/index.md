{{< epigraph cite="Ursula K. LeGuin, The Left Hand of Darkness" >}}
To be an atheist is to maintain God. His existence or nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof.
Thus _proof_ is a word not often used among the Handdarata, who have chosen not to treat God as a fact, subject either to proof or to belief: and they have broken the circle, and go free.

To learn which questions are unanswerable, and _not to answer them_: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.

I recently spent a week on retreat up in the San Bernadino mountains. On the opening night, a teacher defined wisdom as "being grown-ups about our existential condition."
At first that felt like an attack -- surely I'm not being _childish_ -- but after sitting with that in silence for a week, letting it run its course through me, I started to understand my own childishness.
Namely: like children, we grasp at this-or-that explanation of our existence to make ourselves feel secure.

<!-- TODO: This doesn't feel snappy enough. Needs a better hook. -->
If we want to truly be free, we must put that down.

Like many people, I've spent much of my life agonizing over the Big Questions: *what's this all for? Why are we here?*
Our place in the world is ambiguous and confusing, and I needed help navigating it all.
How was I supposed to orient the direction of my life?

<!-- Whole societies focus on refining belief systems around such questions.
And "belief systems" here applies in a broad sense, whether that be religious systems, economic systems, philosophy, nationalism, corporations, ideologies, cults, you name it.
Such systems serve to prop up various aspects of our own identity.

In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism.
There is no such thing as not worshipping.
Everybody worships.
The only choice we get is what to worship.

I hoped primarily to find something definitive, regardless of its contents.
I was waiting for the universe to unveil to me its *[telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology)*, to lift the curtain on a grand mechanism.
Everything would be clear, concrete, unambiguous, and most importantly, secure.
I'd _finally_ be able to get on with my life because at least now it had a _point_.

But that hasn't happened.

The primary reason for this is for me, "purpose" was a crutch, a tool to attempt to govern the inherently chaotic.
I was mistaking the meaning-of-life for finding meaning-*in*-life.{{< sidenote >}}The latter being the focus of the work of folks like [John Vervaeke](https://youtu.be/yImlXr5Tr8g?t=99) and [David Chapman](https://meaningness.com/), among others.{{< /sidenote >}}
The latter is important for happiness and wellbeing -- it's what people most often reference when they say they've had a "meaningful life" -- but it was not the primary concern for me.
The existence of that sort of meaning seemed too obvious to dismiss.
You can feel it in your chest when something in life is meaningful.
To call time spent with friends, the excitement of a child, or the tender care of a loved one "meaningless" is cruel and a denial of the obvious.

I was far more concerned about the meaning _of_ life, as if going through a whole lifetime without uncovering its purpose would be a waste of breath.

I was scared.
Scared that without a meaning-of-life, life was not worth living.

Camus: "A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land." {{< sidenote >}}From _The Myth of Sisyphus_{{< /sidenote >}}

My biggest fear was being a stranger in the world.

---

My fear was being a _stranger_.
It was rooted in a naive assumption: that other people had figured it all out and I hadn't.
Meaning-of-life, framed in this way, becomes a tool, a means to justify one's own existence.
Underlying this is the insidious notion that one's existence *requires justification*, that the purpose of a life is to create a life worth living. {{< sidenote >}}"Feels like I'm sinning when I’d be seeing the light / Cause now I'm working on this living just to rap about life / That's some backwards commitment" -- Jonwayne, ["Out of Sight"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4F21FUL1b8){{< /sidenote >}}
What I most wanted was not actually meaning but approval, a justification of selfhood so deep and so true that it could never be questioned.

But such justification will not be found.
Such a search is just a [snipe hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe_hunt), a neverending chase for something over the horizon.
Once we achieve *this* or create *that* or get *just a bit more* money or recognition or power, then we'll have enough control to be untouchable.
It is the mind clawing its way to [utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia#:~:text=meant%20any%20non%2Dexistent%20society) and coming up empty.

<!-- Meaning-in-life is a helpful foil for understanding this. -->
<!-- Meaning-in-life is rooted in perspective: what is meaningful to one person may not be meaningful to another. -->
<!-- We cannot explain our way into meaning. -->
<!-- It is felt, firmly rooted in our own history and way of seeing the world. -->
<!-- This is a helpful view, of course -- it's a core component of a healthy ego used as part of our daily life and our interactions with others. -->

Meaning-of-life is a metaphysical claim, that at the bottom of the cosmos there's some ground floor, something woven into the fabric of the universe that is the universal good or purpose.
To attempt to answer such a question in fact requires omniscience.
We are mortal: a question of that magnitude is so broad as to be unanswerable.{{< sidenote >}}It's not explicitly in these lists, but it's in the same vein as what many Buddhist traditions refer to as "the imponderables" or "[unanswerable questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unanswerable_questions)."{{< /sidenote >}}

Our task is not to determine the meaning-of-life at the bottom of it all.
Much ink has been spilled trying to find these answers, but this is a distraction.

Rather, our task is to acclimate ourselves to what is true, to put down childish distractions and to take our condition seriously.

<!--
This is not a call to throw those things away, but rather an opportunity to clarify a few distinctions that distracted me for many years.
"Meaning" is
I posit that **putting aside meaning leads to more degrees of freedom than holding onto it**.

Making something "meaningful" requires a perspective -- meaningful *with respect to what*.
For most of us, moments are meaningful to *us*.
What's meaningful to me is not necessarily meaningful to you, so all of our meaning-making systems are inherently self-centered. -->

<!-- And so meaning so often is co-opted as another tool by which we enforce our own egoic framework out onto others. -->
<!-- It is another way in which we try to orient ourselves in a sprawling, confusing, chaotic world that we cannot understand. -->

{{< epigraph cite="Ajahn Sucitto, [&ldquo;Awareness Doesn&rsquo;t Follow Orders&rdquo;](https://ajahnsucitto.org/articles/awareness-doesnt-follow-orders/)" >}}
You can liken the process [of awakening] to a gradual descent out of the tumult and the gridlock of your personal world into the free space of the unconditioned. It’s rather like lowering oneself down a rope. You have to know how to do that. It’s a matter of holding on to something you trust – even though it seems like a thin strand – then letting go a little bit and trusting the downward movement.
{{< /epigraph >}}

Meaning is a tool -- it's something to hold on to as we gradually acclimate ourselves to more and more degrees of freedom.

Centuries of continental philosophy and millions of pages of hand-wringing have been spent on the ambiguous nature of meaning, trying to rationalize it to a point where it makes sense.
This is understandable: a lack of clarity on this front means that our lives are inherently insecure, that change is inevitable *no matter what we do*.
Our inheritance as animals is to fear this, and so we devise tricks, use our brains to find ways around this.
If only we can make the world like *this* then I'll be fine.
Once I get *this* much more I'll be done and can enjoy myself.
But it is not so.

And so to be a grown-up about our existential condition means to see our delusions clearly, to know ourselves.
We have to put down a tool that we're done with in order to pick up something better.

### Finding a Wise Response

Remember: putting aside meaning leads to more degrees of freedom than holding onto it.
What I've written so far may sound awfully nihilistic, but it is not so.

Putting aside meaning isn't a cause for concern: it's a cause for care.
