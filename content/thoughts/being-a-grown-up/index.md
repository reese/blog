{{< epigraph cite="Ursula K. LeGuin, _The Left Hand of Darkness_" >}} To be an
atheist is to maintain God. His existence or nonexistence, it amounts to much
the same, on the plane of proof. Thus _proof_ is a word not often used among the
Handdarata, who have chosen not to treat God as a fact, subject either to proof
or to belief: and they have broken the circle, and go free.

To learn which questions are unanswerable, and _not to answer them_: this skill
is most needful in times of stress and darkness. {{< /epigraph >}}

I recently spent a week on retreat up in the San Bernadino mountains. On the
opening night, a teacher defined wisdom as "being grown-ups about our
existential condition." At first that felt like an attack -- surely I'm not
being _childish_ -- but after sitting in silence for a week, letting those words
run their course through me, I started to see some aspects of my own
childishness.

Namely: like children, we grasp at this-or-that explanation of our existence to
make ourselves feel secure. Explanations of this nature are comfort blankets for
our existential dread, tools that help us navigate our deepest fears.

Our need for security is our inheritance as animals. As we grow up, we develop
the confidence and capacity to work with the unknown, to handle insecurity.

Our hope is that the Final Answer of the Universe will be ultimately fulfilling.
But freedom lies not in the answer, but in the question:

Will knowing the meaning of life actually help?

{{< epigraph cite="C.S. Lewis, _The Weight of Glory_" >}} I am trying to rip
open the inconsolable secret in each one of you—the secret which hurts so much
that you take your revenge on it by calling it names like Nostalgia and
Romanticism and Adolescence; the secret also which pierces with such sweetness
that when, in very intimate conversation, the mention of it becomes imminent, we
grow awkward and affect to laugh at ourselves; the secret we cannot hide and
cannot tell, though we desire to do both. We cannot tell it because it is a
desire for something that has never actually appeared in our experience. We
cannot hide it because our experience is constantly suggesting it, and we betray
ourselves like lovers at the mention of a name. Our commonest expedient is to
call it beauty and behave as if that had settled the matter. {{< /epigraph >}}

I've spent much of my life agonizing over questions like this: _what's this all
for? Why are we here?_ Our place in the world is ambiguous and confusing, and I
needed help navigating it all.

I hoped primarily to find something definitive, regardless of its contents. I
was waiting for the universe to unveil to me its
_[telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology)_, to lift the curtain on a
grand mechanism. Everything would be clear, concrete, unambiguous, and most
importantly, secure. There must surely be a ground, it cannot be
[turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).
I'd _finally_ be able to get on with my life because at least now it had a
_point_.

But that hasn't happened.

The primary reason for this is that for me, "purpose" was a crutch, a tool to
attempt to govern the inherently chaotic. I mistook the meaning-of-life for
finding meaning-_in_-life.{{< sidenote >}}The latter being the focus of the work
of folks like [John Vervaeke](https://youtu.be/yImlXr5Tr8g?t=99) and
[David Chapman](https://meaningness.com/), among others.{{< /sidenote >}} The
latter is important for happiness and wellbeing -- it's what people most often
reference when they say they've had a "meaningful life" -- but it was not the
primary concern for me. The existence of that sort of meaning seemed too obvious
to dismiss. You can feel it in your chest when something in life is meaningful.
To call time spent with friends, the excitement of a child, or the tender care
of a loved one "meaningless" is cruel and a denial of the obvious.

I was far more concerned about the meaning _of_ life, as if going through a
whole lifetime without uncovering its innate purpose would be a waste of breath.

I was scared. Scared that without a meaning-of-life, my life was not worth
living.

Camus: "A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world.
But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights,
man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived
of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land."
{{< sidenote >}}From _The Myth of Sisyphus_{{< /sidenote >}}

My biggest fear was being a stranger in the world.

---

My fear of being a stranger was rooted in a naive assumption: that other people
had figured it all out and I hadn't. I grew up in a religious tradition that
supplied its own answer, and so by that metric other people _did_ have it
figured out, albeit with an answer that I found inconclusive.

Meaning-of-life, framed as a form of social cohesion, becomes a tool, a means of
justifying one's own existence. Underlying this is the insidious notion that
one's existence _requires justification_, that the purpose of a life is to
create a life worth living. {{< sidenote >}}"Feels like I'm sinning when I’d be
seeing the light / Cause now I'm working on this living just to rap about life /
That's some backwards commitment" -- Jonwayne,
["Out of Sight"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4F21FUL1b8){{< /sidenote >}}
What I most wanted was not actually meaning but rather approval, a justification
of selfhood so deep and so true that it could never be questioned.

But that justification will not be found. Such a search is just a
[snipe hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe_hunt), a neverending chase for
something over the horizon. Once we achieve _this_ or create _that_ or get _just
a bit more_ money or recognition or power, then we'll have enough control to be
untouchable. It is the mind clawing its way to
[utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia#:~:text=meant%20any%20non%2Dexistent%20society)
and coming up empty.

Meaning-of-life is a metaphysical claim, that at the bottom of the cosmos
there's some ground floor, something woven into the fabric of the universe that
is the Universal-Good or Purpose. To attempt to answer such a question requires
omniscience, and yet we are mortal: a question of that magnitude is so broad as
to be unanswerable.{{< sidenote >}}It's not explicitly in these lists, but it's
in the same vein as what many Buddhist traditions refer to as "the
imponderables" or
"[unanswerable questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unanswerable_questions)."{{< /sidenote >}}

Our task is not to determine the meaning-of-life at the bottom of it all. Much
ink has been spilled trying to find these answers, but this is a distraction.

Rather, our task is to acclimate ourselves to what is true, to put down childish
distractions and to take responsibility: to be grown-ups.

{{< epigraph cite="Ajahn Sucitto, [&ldquo;Awareness Doesn&rsquo;t Follow Orders&rdquo;](https://ajahnsucitto.org/articles/awareness-doesnt-follow-orders/)" >}}
You can liken the process [of awakening] to a gradual descent out of the tumult and
the gridlock of your personal world into the free space of the unconditioned. It’s
rather like lowering oneself down a rope. You have to know how to do that. It’s a
matter of holding on to something you trust – even though it seems like a thin strand
– then letting go a little bit and trusting the downward movement. {{< /epigraph >}}

"Childish" in this sense is not derogatory. Children are plenty capable of
learning and comprehending complex topics and learning to take responsibility.
But one of the most striking aspects of childhood is what pediatrician and
psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott termed the
"[transitional object](https://dictionary.apa.org/transitional-object)": dolls,
blankets, or any other object used to provide comfort and reduce anxiety in
unique and uncomfortable situations.

Transitional objects ease the child towards independence, helping distinguish
themselves from their primary caregiver. They're a natural part of growing up.
Even adults often maintain a "comfort object" that provides a sense of safety,
like favorite photographs, weighted blankets, or
[objects from their childhood](https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2012/02/21/35-percent-of-British-adults-sleep-with-bear/UPI-49791329806031/).

But much of being a grown-up is not finding things that bring us comfort, but
rather growing our ability to handle insecurity. As we develop, our capacity for
handling new and diverse situations increases -- we take care of a family,
become more involved in community, or take on more complex work projects. And as
we build that capacity, our need for transitional objects often subsides.

In this way, meaning becomes another higher form of transitional objects in our
adult life. We take on new challenges and meet higher-order needs -- the need
for community and recognition and so on -- that become harder and harder to
guarantee through sheer force of will. Transitional objects are, at their core,
illusions of safety. While they're valuable tools to help us regulate, they're
still a marker of fear, something we can always control even in the darkest of
circumstances.

---

How then do we build our capacity for insecurity? We let go of the known, little
by little, finding more and more safety in wider and wider degrees of freedom.

This will be uncomfortable: our body and mind will pull out all manner of
response to prevent insecurity and to continue the march towards security.
Shedding the conventional boundaries of predefined selfhood, of a conventional
life-meaning, requires doing something new.

In order pick up something new, we must first put down the old. We cannot graft
our neurosis out onto the world, but rather must see clearly the boundaries
we've accepted and find new ones, wider ones just past the edge of our comfort
zone.

And we must do this again and again, putting down all our transitional objects
and embracing new freedoms.

---

{{< epigraph cite="James Carse, _Finite and Infinite Games_" >}} Culture is an
enterprise of mortals, disdaining to protect themselves against surprise. Living
in the strength of their vision, they eschew power and make joyous play of
boundaries. {{< /epigraph >}}

In this constant state of letting go, we find a balance: confidence in what we
know and compassion for the unknown. Others around us, we see, are on the same
road, just going at their own pace. Some join us on our journey, and for that
we're grateful. For others, the road ahead is frightening, and for them we're
compassionate, for we know their pain.

Meaning, here, becomes not so much an unanswerable question; it's simply
irrelevant to the project of living. It's a million miles away. Because here,
right here before us, is the joyous freedom to be.

And in that joy, we find our freedom in wide open space. We are redeemed not by
living a definite purpose, but by freeing everything else. I find resonance in
the words of my
[childhood pastor](https://thealabamabaptist.org/jim-barnette-longtime-pastor-and-samford-professor-dies-at-age-59/#:~:text=you%20have%20been%20redeemed%20and%20you%20are%20being%20redeemed),
the words that rang in my ears every Sunday morning:

"And by the love of God, you have been redeemed, and you are _being_ redeemed.
So go in peace."
