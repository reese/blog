I could barely feel my legs at this point. My day started with a vertical march: five kilometers of hills. Hills so steep that even 500 years ago when pilgrims far tougher than I walked these routes, they nicknamed it the "body-breaking slope."

When you climb something like that, with a heavy pack and legs already exhausted, your mind is burning so hot with pain that it becomes empty. It almost inverts itself to the pain; the more miserable you are, the more the cool February air stings your heaving lungs, the simpler the world becomes. Everything pares down to their plainest form: pressure, sensation, hot, cold.

An hour later, a sign marked the top of the pass. I threw down my pack and leaned back against one the many cedar trees that populate the interior of the Kii peninsula. I put my hands on its trunk. Trees can grant you a little boost of energy, if you ask nicely.

Mom used to do that too, put her hands against tree trunks, giving them a hearty pat. She spoke to plants like old friends, offering them help when they drooped or whispering sweet nothings when they bloomed. I started doing the same on these hikes, and every time I think of her.

There against the cedar tree, I could see her walking in front of me, could hear her talking to the trees. I remember her at every shrine, placing a coin down in her memory, bowing slowly.

Up ahead, the path flattens out, taking me across the top of the ridge. A sign marks it as the [_abode of the dead_](https://donnykimball.com/ogumotori-goe-17248b9adb29?srsltid=AfmBOor2NuIAF9pzri-WdOwoER-NSJpjVlBa_MDWluty-CQX_whIqV6y#:~:text=The%20Abode%20of%20the%C2%A0Dead). It's said that the dead come here before moving on, that they come to Amida-ji a short ways away to ring the temple bell. I don't know how, but I saw her there, on the ridge just beyond the collapsed teahouse. I know that much to be true.

I'm sure she rang that bell with a laugh and continued on her way.

Sometimes, a book feels like it was written just for you. Not just for your interests or for whoever you think you are, but meeting you exactly where you are, in your love and suffering and desires and heartaches. That's what Craig Mod's _Things Become Other Things_ is for me.

> As the husband drives me down off the mountain, back to the Ise-ji path, he breaks our silence by saing, She ain't ... our daughter.

> She just appeared seven years back. Wanderin' the country, needin' a job, somehow ... found us. Not a daughter, but like a daughter. Time passes, life moves, and that's what happens: Things become ... other things.

> I hold on to the hope that contrition is fixed within the steps of the very walk itself. Each step, an apology. A million apologies. I want to kiss the foreheads of everyone I see.

> I can write all this down and you still won't understand.

> When all you feel are deficiencies, accepting love from a person or even a place is like trying to fart yourself to the moon.

> The whole thing, an ascetic practice. I even shave my head like some performative mendicant, one who lives off stories as alms.

> As a trade, he tells me that his beautiful wife is dead. He misses her _tonkatsu_ pork chops. He uses her shampoo on his head of thick curls. Still whispers goodnight to her as he shuts the inn up for the day. The more he speaks, the more he drinks. He sidles up, thigh-against-thigh, holds forth at length. Outside, the rain comes down in sheets. Fills the room with storm energy. You got a real shit sandwich for weather, he says with a savage grin, pouring himself another drink.

> The owner has seen much, moves in unexpected ways, carries someone else's name. His wife is gone. His head smells of flowers. Whiskey on the breath, he laughs loud and hard and has traveled far from who he once was.
