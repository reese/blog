> I hold on to the hope that contrition is fixed within the steps of the very walk itself. Each step, an apology. A million apologies. I want to kiss the foreheads of everyone I see.

{{< /quote-highlight >}}

I can barely feel my legs. The day started with a vertical march: five kilometers of hills. Hills so steep that even hundreds of years ago, when pilgrims far tougher than I walked these routes, they nicknamed it the "body-breaking slope."

At that point of exhaustion, with a heavy back and legs already shot before even leaving the door, my mind burns so hot with pain that it becomes empty. It almost inverts itself to the pain: the more miserable I am, the simpler the world becomes. The cool January air stings my lungs. Everything pares down to its plainest form: pressure, sensation, heat.

An hour later, a sign marks the top of the pass. I threw down my pack and leaned back against one the many cedar trees that populate the interior of the Kii peninsula. I put my hands on its trunk. Trees can grant you a little boost of energy, if you ask nicely.

Mom used to do that too, put her hands on tree trunks, giving them a hearty pat. She spoke to plants like friends, offering them help when they drooped or whispering sweet nothings when they bloomed. I started doing the same on these hikes. Every time I think of her.

There against the cedar tree, I see her walking in front of me, hear her whispering to the trees, her voice merging with the soft murmur of leaves. I remember her at every shrine. I place coins down in her memory, bowing slowly.

Up ahead, the path flattens out, taking me across the top of the ridge. A sign marks it as the [_abode of the dead_](https://donnykimball.com/ogumotori-goe-17248b9adb29?srsltid=AfmBOor2NuIAF9pzri-WdOwoER-NSJpjVlBa_MDWluty-CQX_whIqV6y#:~:text=The%20Abode%20of%20the%C2%A0Dead). I heard that the dead pass through here, that they come to Amida-ji a short ways away to ring the temple bell before moving on. I don't know how, but I see her there, passing over the ridge just beyond the collapsed teahouse. I know that much to be true.

I pick up my pack to continue on my way. A temple bell rings in the distance. And again. And again.

Sometimes, a book feels like it was written just for me. Not just for my particular interests or for who I want to be, but for me right here and now, with whatever suffering and joy and heartache is there. A book just for me-right-now: Craig Mod's [_Things Become Other Things_](https://bookshop.org/a/97650/9780593732540).

TBOT follows Mod as he embarks on a long journey across the Kii peninsula in Japan, following ancient pilgrimage routes and meeting _kissa_ owners, farmers, fishermen, and loud-mouthed children. Along the way, he experiences an area in decline, harkening back to his industrial hometown.

This book is really an extended letter to Bryan, Mod’s childhood friend murdered decades before but whose memory, in the quiet persistence of many weeks of walking, rises up and imprints itself. The trail, the people, old memories all intertwine, flow into and out of each other, forming vignettes depicting how places adapt — or fail to adapt — to economic decline, natural disasters, and the ever-shifting sands of time.

I also hiked this area -- albeit just for a few days, a small fraction of Mod's total journey -- in January of this year, so the experience was fresh on my mind as I flipped through. \[TODO: flesh this bit out.]

Throughout the book, we meet a wide cast of characters. Some we glimpse for just a moment: an inn owner remembering his late wife, weather-beaten farmers enjoying a bath, an _okonomiyaki_ shop owner who welcomes death. Each and every one of their perspectives articulate the contours of a world constantly undergoing change. Mod handles all of them with care. On this front, it’s especially refreshing that Mod describes their actions and translates their speech completely without pretense, without the awkward othering and mystique that’s often used to describe life in Japan. Each one appears in full-color:

> As the husband drives me down off the mountain, back to the Ise-ji path, he breaks our silence by saying, She ain't ... our daughter.
>
> [...]
>
> She just appeared seven years back. Wanderin' the country, needin' a job, somehow ... found us. Not a daughter, but like a daughter. Time passes, life moves, and that's what happens: Things become ... other things.

Brief conversations like this -- in the car, ordering food, walking past a rice field -- illuminate a group that, despite its decline, is supported and seen.

> When all you feel are deficiencies, accepting love from a person or even a place is like trying to fart yourself to the moon.

---

> The whole thing, an ascetic practice. I even shave my head like some performative mendicant, one who lives off stories as alms.

---

> I can write all this down and you still won't understand.

> As a trade, he tells me that his beautiful wife is dead. He misses her _tonkatsu_ pork chops. He uses her shampoo on his head of thick curls. Still whispers goodnight to her as he shuts the inn up for the day. The more he speaks, the more he drinks. He sidles up, thigh-against-thigh, holds forth at length. Outside, the rain comes down in sheets. Fills the room with storm energy. You got a real shit sandwich for weather, he says with a savage grin, pouring himself another drink.

> The owner has seen much, moves in unexpected ways, carries someone else's name. His wife is gone. His head smells of flowers. Whiskey on the breath, he laughs loud and hard and has traveled far from who he once was.
